# GuessTheNumber
Guess the number is a game (user v/s computer) in which the computer randomly guess a number between the specific range. And the user has to guess the number correctly. 
To make it more interesting, the user has a limit of tries to guess the number. If he guessed accurately, he win else looses or has to try again.
If you win or loose, the game gives you an option to try again(using keyword 'y' or 'Y')rather than running it again.
Lets play!
